# Decision_Tree_on_Pool_Inspection_data
Testing how accurate are the predictions made using a decision tree trained on location data

At this point in time, the decision trees that I know of are trained on quantitative data. Location data is not quanititative, which makes it interesting to test if it is feasible to make a decision tree using location data. 

This project will use the DOHMH Pool Inspections dataset from NYC Opendata.

The data in this dataset was provided by: Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Office of Public Health Engineering (DOHMH)

packages used in this project are: 

pandas, to access the dataset

sklearn, where the decision tree classifier comes from

graphviz, to visualize the decision tree

numpy, to work on arrays
